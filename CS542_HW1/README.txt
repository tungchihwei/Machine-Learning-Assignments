In my code, it use the result from my first game and but the 100 result to a string. And it'll ask user to input first 5 moves of user's and computer's. After getting the first 5 moves it will update these to the string and use the last 4 inputs of user's and check the database. If there's a same, then it will get what human will throw next after these 4 moves and give user a suggestion.

For example:
If the last 4 inputs of mine are SCISSORS, PAPER, ROCK, SCISSORS and the most next moves in string is ROCK. Then I assume that the computer will thinck that I'm going to throw ROCK, so it won't throw SCISSORS. To be safe I thinck throwing PAPER will be better than throwing ROCK, so the program will suggest user to throw PAPER.

After giving a suggestion, it will update the result of the suggestion to the string.
